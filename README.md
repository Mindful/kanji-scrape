Kanji-Scrape
--------------

A simple chrome addon that scrapes the web page you're on for any Kanji (as far as the addon is concerned, this means any characters with numerical values >= 0x4e00 and <= 0x9faf ). It alerts you of any Kanji you've never seen before, as well as listing ones on the page that you have seen before, in ascending order based on how many times you've seen them. Data is stored in chrome synchronized storage.
